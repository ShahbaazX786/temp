# Express Server
This is a server I created as a repo to just import the code and modify in projects to speed up process.
<pre>
    -->Even though writing code from scratch improves your knowledge
       as it is just like practising the code again and again.
<br>
    -->But I think the routes will be different for different project
       requirements so just create a basic quicksave like repo wil be 
       quite handy. 
<br>
    -->Ps: To run server just exec command "Nodemon app.js" or "Nodemon start" in terminal.
